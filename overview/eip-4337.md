EIP-4337 is an improvement to the transaction types on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a_n account abstraction proposal that completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal instead introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">`UserOperation`</mark>._

&#x20;_Users send `UserOperation` objects into a separate mempool. A special class of actor called bundlers package up a set of these objects into a transaction making a `handleOps` call to a special contract, and that transaction then gets included in a block_&#x20;

### Goals Of EIP-4337

* **Account Abstraction**: Allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs(externally owned accounts) as their primary account. Completely remove any need at all for users also to have EOAs&#x20;
*   **Decentralization:**&#x20;

    Allow any bundler (think: block builder) to participate in the process of including account-abstracted user operations.
* **Does not require any Ethereum consensus change and more**

To better under the reason for the change and what exactly the `UserOperation` object does, please read the proposal. [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4337.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4337.md)
