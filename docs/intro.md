# Introduction

Let's briefly explain the term  **paymaster**.

## What is a Paymaster ?

A paymaster is simply a person or an organization in charge of 
distributing payments on behalf of a company
or government agency.

In some cases, paymasters may be internal employees of an organization who are responsible for managing payroll and ensuring that all employees are paid accurately and on time. In other cases, paymasters may be external vendors who are contracted to provide payroll services to the organization.

Paymasters may also be responsible for managing other financial transactions, such as the payment of invoices or the disbursement of funds to contractors or suppliers. They typically have access to sensitive financial information and must maintain a high level of accuracy and confidentiality in their work.

## Paymasters in Web3 

In the context of Web3, the term "paymaster" refers to a smart contract that 
is responsible for managing payments between different parties within a decentralized 
application (dApp) or blockchain network.

Paymasters in Web3 typically act as intermediaries between users and the blockchain network, helping to facilitate transactions and ensure that all parties involved in a payment are properly compensated. For example, a paymaster might be used to facilitate micropayments between users of a social media platform, or to manage payments between buyers and sellers on an e-commerce site.

One key advantage of using a paymaster in Web3 is that it can help to reduce transaction fees and increase the efficiency of payment processing. 


## ZkSync

Paymasters on this platform Leverages on account abstraction using zkSync. Zksync is a layer2 scaling platform for ethereum.
zkSync uses a form of zero-knowledge cryptography known as zkRollups to enable fast and cheap transactions on the Ethereum network. Paymasters within the network play a crucial role in ensuring that these transactions are properly processed and that users are able to make payments and transfer funds quickly and efficiently.

Paymasters in zkSync act as trusted intermediaries between users and the network, managing the transfer of funds and ensuring that all transactions are properly authenticated and authorized. They help to facilitate payments between users and dApps within the network, and can also be used to manage other financial transactions such as the payment of fees or the distribution of rewards.

One key advantage of using paymasters in zkSync is that they can help to reduce the cost and complexity of processing transactions on the Ethereum network. By enabling faster and cheaper payments, paymasters can help to increase the adoption and usability of decentralized applications and other Web3 services.

<!-- ### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```


Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
